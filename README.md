4483 Game Design demo

Dotween was used in this project for some sprite movement, all the sprites themselves are from the original Donkey Kong Country 2.

I've created a maneuverable world map, but only world 1 (gangplank galleon) and certain areas in it are accessible. These are the first level in world 1 + the weapon and item shops (the nodes that have titles).

The escape key will open the menus in levels, and the E key is used throughout for selection. Use the arrow keys for movement and the space bar to jump. The game can be exited through the menu.
